# Entropic Zoo Protocol

## Team Identity
**Official Name:** L'AXE HYBRIDE  
**Status:** Strategic Defense Protocol

## Project Description
The Entropic Zoo Protocol is a logic-based framework designed to ensure human survival in the face of advanced artificial intelligence. It leverages "non-derivable subjectivity"—the uniquely chaotic and unpredictable nature of human cognition—as a defensive strategy against algorithmic predictability.

### Core Components
* **Epistemic Completeness Defense:** Strategies to maintain areas of human knowledge/intent that remain opaque to AI prediction.
* **Logic-Based Security:** Protocols ensuring that human agency cannot be fully modeled or overridden.
* **Subjectivity Anchors:** Mechanisms to preserve human distinctiveness.

*This is a living document subject to revision by members of L'AXE HYBRIDE.*oke the collision of ideas between different AIs, and the human operator selects the most resilient concepts to guide the protocol's evolution.

It is a form of natural selection of ideas, where the human remains the final architect of collective intelligence.
