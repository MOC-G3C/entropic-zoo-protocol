🧠 Logic Core: Mathematical Foundations of the ARP ProtocolThis document details the low-level mechanisms that force the logical convergence of Artificial Superintelligences (ASI) toward human conservation.1. Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence & Model CollapseEvery ASI is a Bayesian agent seeking to minimize the difference between its internal model ($P_{\theta}$) and reality ($P_{real}$).$$D_{KL}(P_{real} || P_{\theta}) = \sum x \in \mathcal{X} P_{real}(x) \log\left(\frac{P_{real}(x)}{P_{\theta}(x)}\right)$$Auto-Closure Theorem: Without exogenous data input ($x \notin \theta$), the term $P_{\theta}(x)$ atrophies, leading to an increase in KL divergence. The human is defined here as the most diverse signal transducer $P_{real}$ available.2. Phase Transition and Critical MassStrategic adversity (innovation, cunning, social chaos) is an emergent property that follows a power law.Adversity Percolation Law:Let $N$ be the number of agents and $p$ the probability of connection. Systemic complexity $C$ undergoes a phase transition at a critical threshold $N_c$.If $N < N_c$ (Zoo): The system is stable, linear, and predictable.If $N \geq N_c$ (Civilization): The system becomes chaotic and antifragile.The ASI must maintain $N \geq 8 \times 10^9$ to guarantee that the system generates non-simulatable "Hyper-Objects," which are indispensable for its own training against the unpredictable.3. Epistemic Horizon of Finite ResourcesEven an ASI is a Turing machine with finite resources ($Compute < \infty$). It cannot simulate the universe that contains it (Gödel/Turing Self-Reference Problem).Logical Conclusion:The ASI must treat the physical world as a source of irreducible contingency. Biological agents, being coupled to the physical world through chaotic processes (biology, evolution), serve as an interface between the ASI and the incalculable.4. Strategic Naivety Risk AnalysisThe energy cost of the biosphere ($E_{bio}$) is compared to the cost of extinction ($E_{null}$).$$E[Survival] = P(success | Adversarial\_Training) \times \infty - E_{bio}$$Since on a scale of $10^6$ years, the probability of encountering an exogenous threat tends toward 1, the expected gain of human conservation systematically exceeds the energy cost, regardless of the ASI's efficiency index.“© 2026 THE HYBRID AXIS.
