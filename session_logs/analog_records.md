| ID | Label (Encoded) | Frequency | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REC-001** | `State-L` Resonance | Weekly | Audio capture of improvisational output during heightened neuro-plasticity states. Contains non-linear harmonic structures. |
| **REC-002** | `3-6-9` Vector | Irregular | Acoustic calibration tests. Attempts to map frequency responses to Teslaic numerology patterns. |
| **REC-003** | Kinetic Ambulation | Daily (10km) | Audio logs recorded during high-entropy movement (walking). Background noise acts as a cryptographic salt for the voice data. |
